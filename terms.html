                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 12, 2025</p>

                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By downloading, installing, or using KlipCam, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all
                    applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these terms, please do not use the

                <h2>2. App License and Usage</h2>
                <p>MILIVON grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use KlipCam for personal,
                    non-commercial purposes only. Under this license, you may not:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modify, copy, or create derivative works of the app</li>
                    <li>Use the app for any commercial purpose without written permission</li>
                    <li>Attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or extract source code</li>

                <h2>3. Privacy-First Design</h2>
                <p>KlipCam is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not require user accounts for basic
                    usage, and your images are stored locally on your device. When you use AI generation features,
                    images are temporarily processed by third-party AI services and automatically deleted after
                    processing.</p>

                <h2>4. AI Content Generation Terms</h2>
                <p>KlipCam uses artificial intelligence to generate and modify images and videos, including AI
                    Influencers and Avatars. By using our AI features, you understand and agree that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> All output is created using artificial intelligence and

                    <li><strong>Content Accuracy:</strong> AI-generated content may not accurately represent real
                        people, places, or objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> AI results may vary and are not guaranteed to meet your
                        expectations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing Limitations:</strong> Processing may take time and could occasionally fail
                        due to technical issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Availability:</strong> We do not guarantee the availability or uptime of AI
                        services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Updates:</strong> AI models may be updated, which could affect output quality or
                        style.</li>
                </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AI Model Rights:</strong> We do not claim ownership of AI models or training data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage License:</strong> You grant us a license to process your images for AI generation
                        purposes only.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Training Use:</strong> Your images will not be used to train or improve AI models.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Rights:</strong> Generated content must not violate third-party rights or
