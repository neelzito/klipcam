                        <summary>How do credits work?</summary>
                        <p>KlipCam operates on a credit system. You receive a set number of credits each month based on your subscription plan (Starter, Creator, or Pro). Credits are used to generate AI photos and videos. If you run out, you can wait for your monthly renewal or upgrade your plan for more.</p>

                        <summary>How do I cancel my subscription?</summary>
                        <p>Your subscription is managed directly through your Apple ID. To cancel, go to your iPhone Settings > tap your name (Apple ID) > Subscriptions > KlipCam > Cancel Subscription. You will continue to have access until the end of your current billing period.</p>

                        <summary>Can I use the images for commercial purposes?</summary>
                        <p>Yes! If you are subscribed to our Creator or Pro plans, you have full commercial rights to the images and videos you generate. You can use them for your business, social media marketing, ads, and more.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Is my data private?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely. Privacy is our core principle. We use a randomly generated identifier to keep your usage anonymous. Your photos are processed temporarily by our AI partners and are not permanently stored on our servers. We do not use your personal photos to train our public models.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What if my generation fails?</summary>
                        <p>On rare occasions, an AI generation might fail due to server load or connectivity issues. If this happens, your credits should not be deducted (or will be refunded automatically). Please check your internet connection and try again. If the issue persists, please contact support.</p>

                        <summary>How do I delete my account?</summary>
                        <p>Since KlipCam uses anonymous identifiers by default, you can simply delete the app to remove your local data. If you have linked an account or want to ensure all server-side data associated with your device ID is wiped, you can use the "Delete Account" option found in the app's Settings menu.</p>
